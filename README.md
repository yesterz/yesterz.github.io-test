  **Night watcher swear** <br/>
  <br/>
  Night gathers, and now my watch begins. <br/>
  It shall not end until my death. <br/>
  I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. <br/>
  I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. <br/>
  I shall live and die at my post. <br/>
  I am the sword in the darkness. <br/>
  I am the watcher on the walls. <br/>
  I am the fire that burns against the cold, <br/>
  the light that brings the dawn, <br/>
  the horn that wakes the sleepers, <br/>
  the shield that guards the realms of men. <br/>
  I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, <br/>
  for this night and all the nights to come.<br/>
